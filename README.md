# ColonyShip
Console RPG in Space

You awake in the sleeping bay of the semi-sentient Colony Ship. It is odd that you are the only one awoken, but as you look around you discover that is the LEAST odd thing...the ship and its contents have gone crazy, and it is up to you to fix it.

Colony Ship is a console RPG (in the best traditions of Rogue) but set on a spaceship which will morph as you sleep, so that each day you must rediscover your way as you attempt to reach the core and set the ship right. Something bad must have happened because not only is ship itself (mostly) insane, its denizens are oddly mutated descendants of plants, animals, and hitchhikers.

Choose from a set of colonist specializations which will guide your playing style: slow but strong miner; tech savvy engineer, accurate security officer; or even the ship's sentient canine.

Discover equipment, find free-energy cells (for trade), map out the lift system (the only part of the ship which is fixed), attempt to find allies (if indeed they exist), and ultimately attempt to put the ship to rights.

Available on Windows and Ubuntu, Spring 2020.
